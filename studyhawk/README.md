# StudyHawk

**StudyHawk** allows users to create study decks and study the flashcards within them. They can create multiple decks of cards and, in each deck, create flashcards. These cards allow the user to add a term, a definition, and a picture if the user chooses.

**StudyHawk** solves Quizlet's issues with paywalls and gives users (students at Miami University) a good place to study their work.
